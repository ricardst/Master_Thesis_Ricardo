    "# Debug Labels - Activity Co-occurrence Analysis with Efficient Label-Centered Windowing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs comprehensive activity co-occurrence analysis using an **efficient label-centered windowing approach** that generates 3-minute windows around the start of target activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **Raw Data Processing** (like raw_data_processor.py)\n",
    "1. **Loading raw sensor data** directly from CSV files for the selected subject\n",
    "2. **Applying configurable time corrections**:\n",
    "   - Sensor timestamp shifts (easily toggle on/off)\n",
    "   - Sensor drift corrections (easily toggle on/off) \n",
    "   - Label time corrections (easily toggle on/off)\n",
    "3. **Signal processing**:\n",
    "   - Duplicate timestamp handling\n",
    "   - Missing data interpolation\n",
    "   - Optional resampling to target frequency\n",
    "   - Optional lowpass filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Efficient Activity Co-occurrence Detection** ⚡\n",
    "4. **Building continuous activity timeline** from corrected labels\n",
    "5. **Applying activity label remapping** using Activity_Mapping_v2.csv\n",
    "6. **Smart window generation**: Creates 3-minute windows **centered around target activity starts** (much faster than exhaustive search)\n",
    "7. **Duplicate window removal**: Merges overlapping windows automatically\n",
    "8. **Co-occurrence validation**: Ensures both activities are present with minimum duration requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 **Window Analysis & Comprehensive Visualization** 🎨\n",
    "9. **Per-window activity timelines**: Each window stores its own activity timeline for efficient processing\n",
    "10. **Generating PDF plots** with one window per page showing:\n",
    "    - **Complete activity timeline** with ALL present activities highlighted and color-coded\n",
    "    - **Target activities** marked with special indicators (⭐ stars)\n",
    "    - **Trigger activity** marked with special indicator (🎯 target)\n",
    "    - All sensor channels during the 3-minute window\n",
    "    - **Unique color backgrounds** for each activity type (blue for target 1, green for target 2, other colors for additional activities)\n",
    "    - Window boundaries, center markers, and trigger information\n",
    "    - **Comprehensive legend** showing all activities with clear identification\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ **Easy Configuration**\n",
    "- **Toggle time corrections** independently to see their effects\n",
    "- **Adjust window parameters** (size, minimum durations)\n",
    "- **Modify activities and subjects** for different analyses\n",
    "- **Control processing parameters** (frequency, filtering, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **Key Advantages of New Approach**\n",
    "- **⚡ Much faster**: Only generates windows around actual activity starts (not exhaustive search)\n",
    "- **🎯 More targeted**: Focuses on periods when target activities actually occur\n",
    "- **📊 Better coverage**: Captures the most relevant activity transition periods\n",
    "- **🔄 Efficient storage**: Each window contains its own activity timeline\n",
    "- **📈 Scalable**: Performance doesn't degrade with longer data sequences\n",
    "- **🎨 Complete visualization**: ALL activities highlighted, not just targets\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Windowing Strategy**\n",
    "- **Trigger-based**: Windows are centered on target activity start times\n",
    "- **3-minute duration**: 1.5 minutes before and after each activity start\n",
    "- **Automatic deduplication**: Overlapping windows are merged\n",
    "- **Co-occurrence validation**: Both activities must be present with minimum duration\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎨 **Enhanced Activity Visualization**\n",
    "- **🎯 Target activities**: Special highlighting with blue (target 1) and green (target 2)\n",
    "- **⭐ Star markers**: Target activities clearly marked in legend\n",
    "- **🎪 Other activities**: Unique color coding (orange, purple, brown, pink, etc.)\n",
    "- **🎯 Trigger indicators**: Shows which activity triggered window creation\n",
    "- **📊 Background coloring**: All activity periods shown with colored backgrounds on sensor plots\n",
    "- **🔍 Complete legend**: Shows all present activities with clear identification\n",
    "- **💡 Activity context**: Easy to see activity transitions and overlaps\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 **Analysis Output**\n",
    "The output PDF contains detailed plots showing:\n",
    "- **Complete activity timeline** - when ALL activities occur within the 3-minute window\n",
    "- **Enhanced activity identification** - stars for targets, trigger markers, unique colors\n",
    "- **Trigger information** - which activity triggered the window creation\n",
    "- **Multi-sensor data** - all sensor channels synchronized to the same time window\n",
    "- **Visual markers** - window boundaries, center points, and activity periods\n",
    "- **Duration information** - how long each activity is present in the window\n",
    "- **Activity context** - see all activities happening during the analysis period\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect for analyzing sensor behavior when multiple activities occur, understanding complex activity patterns, labeling accuracy during multi-activity scenarios, and debugging time alignment issues. The enhanced visualization shows the complete activity context, not just the two target activities."

    "**New Approach**: Instead of exhaustively searching all possible 3-minute windows (which is slow), we now generate windows more efficiently by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding target activity starts**: Look for all instances where our target activities (`FROM_ACTIVITY` and `TO_ACTIVITY`) begin\n",
    "2. **Creating centered windows**: Generate 3-minute windows centered around each target activity start (1.5 minutes before, 1.5 minutes after)\n",
    "3. **Removing duplicates**: If multiple activities start close together, merge overlapping windows\n",
    "4. **Validating co-occurrence**: Check each window to ensure both target activities are present with sufficient duration\n",

    "**Benefits**:\n",

    "- 🎯 **More targeted**: Focuses on periods when activities are actually happening\n",
    "- 📊 **Better coverage**: Ensures we capture the most relevant time periods\n",
    "- 🔄 **Per-window timelines**: Each window stores its own activity timeline for efficient plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window Criteria**:\n",
    "- Window size: 3 minutes (configurable)\n",
    "- Minimum activity duration: 2 seconds each (configurable)\n",
